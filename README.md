# Tower Defense
Simple tower defense game which is written in javascript with node.js as server. Each player has gold and can place towers everywhere except for the places where structures are already built. Enemies will constantly spawn and try to get to the nearest spawn building. If there is no path, they will destroy the nearest structure. Players can help each other and try to get a high score or battle each other by griefing each other.
